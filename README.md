Applied ML Project 4

I chose to go my own route on this assignment (not do a streamlit app or anything). I had never worked with golf data before in an ML project, and being a big golfer, I had to go for it. Something I was very curious about figuring out was web scraping. I know it is being used by many companies out there today for marketing and advertising reasons, but I wasn't sure how it worked.

The purpose of my project is to scrape PGA tour data off of the PGA tour website and utilize it to make predictions on that golfer's world ranking. 

Web scraping required me to delve more into the specific html of the website to get the data I needed. I utilized BeautifulSoup to grab the specifc html of the tables I needed on each page.

I learned that I needed to scrape alot more data to make the ML models predict successfully! Regardless, I learned how exactly to web scrape and gained experience in all the pandas functionality I needed to combine and clean all that data. More takeaways are at the bottom of the jupyter notebook.

If you want more information on each of the golf statistics I pulled and what they mean, you can find it at the bottom of each table on their respective page. This can be accessed from here: https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html
